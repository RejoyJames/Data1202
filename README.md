# Confusion Matrix and Classification Matrix for Neural Network Algorithm

**copyright Rejoy James (2021)**

On applying the Artificial Neural Network Algorithm on available drug data, we analyse the findings using the algorithm and also derive key insights for Mr. Hughes.

## Prerequisites
Use Python ( Jupyter Notebook ) for this code.

## Dependencies
- File used for this analysis is 'drugdataset.csv'
- Install all required libraries for running the python(using jupyter notebook)
- Load libraries pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot.

## Usage
#### Importing Libraries
#### Load dataset into 'drugdataset.csv' for building model
#### Understanding the available drugs in the system
#### Define x(independent)and y(dependent) variables
#### Split the dataset in training set and test set
#### Data pre-processing involves splitting the data into training and test set.
#### Data pre-processing involves splitting the data into training and test set.
#### Feature scaling or data normalization
- Feature scaling or data normalization is a method used to normalize the range of independent variables or features of data. So, when the values vary a lot in an independent variable, we use feature scaling so that all the values remain in the comparable range.
#### Final Step: Artificial Neural Network Algorithm Scripting, Evaluation Report & Matrix Generation
- Generation of Confusion Matrix and Classification Report


**Note:- The code can be used on your dataset in various situations and run it. Also note that the accuracy is determined by the dataset used**

## Dataset for analysis
Dataset used for this analysis is uploaded in repository as 'drugdataset.csv' - see this [drugdataset.csv](drugdataset.csv)
